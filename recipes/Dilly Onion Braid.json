Beat on medium speed for 2 minutes. Add the onion, dill seed and dill weed; mix well. Stir in enough remaining flour to form a soft dough. Turn onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 6-8 minutes. Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease top. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1-1/2 hours.", "Punch dough down. Turn onto a lightly floured surface; divide into thirds. Cover and let rest for 10 minutes. Shape each into an 18-in. rope. Place ropes on a greased baking sheet and braid; pinch seams to seal and tuck ends under. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 30 minutes. Beat egg yolk and cold water; brush over braid. Bake at 350 degrees F for 30-40 minutes or until golden brown. Remove from pan to a wire rack to cool."], "Image": "http://images.media-allrecipes.com/userphotos/250x250/987356.jpg", "Recipe": "Dilly Onion Braid", "Ingredients": ["1 cup sour cream", "1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast", "1/4 cup warm water (105 degrees to 115 degrees)", "1 egg", "2 tablespoons butter or margarine, softened", "2 tablespoons sugar", "1 1/2 teaspoons salt", "2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour", "1/3 cup finely chopped onion", "1 tablespoon dill seed", "1 teaspoon dill weed", "1 egg yolk", "2 teaspoons cold water"]}
