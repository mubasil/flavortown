{"Directions": ["In a saucepan, combine orange juice and cranberries; bring to a boil. Reduce heat. Simmer, uncovered, for 5 minutes or until cranberries are softened; drain. In a mixing bowl, beat cream cheese, confectioners' sugar and lemon extract until smooth. Fold in cranberry mixture. Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour. Meanwhile, in a mixing bowl, cream butter and sugar. Beat in egg and sweet potatoes. Combine the dry ingredients; gradually add to creamed mixture. Fold in cranberries and nuts. Transfer to a greased 9-in. x 5-in. x 3-in. loaf pan. Bake at 350 degrees F for 55-65 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean. Cover loosely with foil if the top browns too quickly. Cool for 10 minutes before removing from pan to a wire rack. Serve with the cream cheese spread."], "Image": "http://images.media-allrecipes.com/userphotos/250x250/985193.jpg", "Recipe": "Cranberry Sweet Potato Bread", "Ingredients": ["1 cup orange juice", "1/2 cup dried cranberries", "1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened", "3 tablespoons confectioners' sugar", "1 teaspoon lemon extract", "DOUGH:", "1/3 cup butter or margarine, softened", "1 1/4 cups sugar", "1 egg", "1 cup cold mashed sweet potatoes", "1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour", "1 teaspoon ground cinnamon", "1/2 teaspoon baking powder", "1/2 teaspoon baking soda", "1/2 teaspoon salt", "1/2 cup dried cranberries", "1/2 cup chopped macadamia nuts or almonds"]}
