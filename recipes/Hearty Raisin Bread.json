{"Directions": ["In a mixing bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water. Add the milk, butter, honey, salt, cinnamon, eggs and whole whet flour. Beat until smooth. Stir in enough all-purpose flour to form a soft dough. Turn onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 8-10 minutes. Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease top. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 hour. Punch dough down. Turn onto a lightly floured surface; sprinkle with raisins and knead in. Divide in half. Shape into loaves. Place in two greased 9-in. x 5-in. x 3-in. loaf pans. Cover and let rise until doubled, about 45 minutes. Beat egg white and cold water; brush over dough. Bake at 375 degrees F for 35-40 minutes or until golden brown. Cover loosely with oil if top browns too quickly. Remove from pans to wire racks to cool."], "Image": "http://images.media-allrecipes.com/userphotos/250x250/811672.jpg", "Recipe": "Hearty Raisin Bread", "Ingredients": ["2 (.25 ounce) packages active dry yeast", "1/2 cup warm water (110 degrees F to 115 degrees F)", "1 1/2 cups warm milk (110 to 115 degrees F)", "1/2 cup butter or margarine, melted", "1/4 cup honey", "2 teaspoons salt", "1 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon", "2 eggs", "3 cups whole wheat flour", "3 1/2 cups all-purpose flour", "2 cups raisins", "1 egg white", "2 tablespoons cold water"]}
