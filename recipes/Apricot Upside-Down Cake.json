{"Directions": ["Drain apricots, reserving 3 tablespoons juice (discard remaining juice or save for another use); set aside. Place butter in a greased 9-in. square baking pan; place in a 350 degrees F oven for 3-4 minutes or until melted. Stir in the brown sugar. Arrange apricot halves, cut side up, in a single layer over sugar. In a mixing bowl, beat egg yolks on high for 4 minutes or until thick and lemon-colored. Gradually beat in sugar. Stir in reserved apricot juice. Combine flour, baking powder and salt; gradually add to egg yolk mixture. In another mixing bowl, beat egg whites until stiff. Fold into yolk mixture. Carefully spread over apricots. Bake at 350 degrees F for 35-40 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center of cake comes out clean. Cool for 10 minutes before inverting onto a serving plate."], "Image": "http://images.media-allrecipes.com/userphotos/250x250/979362.jpg", "Recipe": "Apricot Upside-Down Cake", "Ingredients": ["2 (15 ounce) cans apricot halves", "1/4 cup butter or margarine", "1/2 cup packed brown sugar", "2 eggs, separated", "2/3 cup sugar", "2/3 cup cake flour", "3/4 teaspoon baking powder", "1/4 teaspoon salt"]}
