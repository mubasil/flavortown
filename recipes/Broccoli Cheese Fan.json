{"Directions": ["In a mixing bowl, combine 2-1/4 cups flour, sugar, yeast and salt. In a saucepan, heat water and butter to 120 degrees F-130 degrees F. Add to dry ingredients; beat until smooth. Stir in enough remaining flour to form a soft dough. Turn onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 4 minutes. Cover and let rest for 10 minutes.", "Meanwhile, in a bowl, combine broccoli, cheese, bacon, egg, onion and oregano. On a lightly floured surface, roll dough into a 16-in. x 9-in. rectangle with a 16-in. side facing you. Spoon broccoli mixture lengthwise over top two-thirds of dough to within 1 in. of edges. Starting at the plain long side, fold dough over half of filling; fold over again. Pinch seams to seal and tuck ends under. Place, seam side down, on a greased baking sheet. With a sharp knife, cut into eight strips to within 1 in. of pinched edge. Separate strips slightly; twist to allow filling to show. Place a large shallow pan on the counter; fill half full with boiling water. Place baking sheet containing bread over the water-filled pan. Cover and let rise until doubled, about 15 minutes. Beat egg white and cold water; brush over dough. Bake at 400 degrees F for 25 minutes or until golden brown. Remove from pan to a wire rack. Serve warm. Refrigerate leftovers."], "Image": "http://images.media-allrecipes.com/userphotos/250x250/984740.jpg", "Recipe": "Broccoli Cheese Fan", "Ingredients": ["3 1/4 cups all-purpose flour", "1 tablespoon sugar", "1 (.25 ounce) package quick-rise yeast", "1 teaspoon salt", "1 cup water", "1 tablespoon butter or margarine, softened", "1 1/2 cups finely chopped broccoli, cooked and drained", "1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese", "5 bacon strips, cooked and crumbled", "1 egg", "1/2 teaspoon dried minced onion", "1/2 teaspoon dried oregano", "1 egg white", "1 tablespoon cold water"]}
