{"Directions": ["In a mixing bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water. Add the butter, honey, eggs, salt and 4 cups flour. Beat on low speed for 30 seconds. Beat on medium for 3 minutes. Stir in enough remaining flour to form a soft dough. Turn onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 8 minutes. Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease top. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled; about 1 hour. Punch dough down.  Divide into thirds. Shape into loaves. Place in three greased 8-in. x 4-in. x 2-in. loaf pans. Cover and let rise until doubled, about 30 minutes. Bake at 375 degrees F for 25-30 minutes or until golden brown. Remove from pans to wire racks to cool."], "Image": "http://images.media-allrecipes.com/userphotos/250x250/760275.jpg", "Recipe": "Honey White Loaves", "Ingredients": ["2 (.25 ounce) packages active dry yeast", "2 1/2 cups warm water (110 degrees to 115 degrees)", "1/2 cup butter or margarine, melted", "1/2 cup honey", "2 eggs", "1 tablespoon salt", "8 cups all-purpose flour"]}
