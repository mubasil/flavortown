{"Directions": ["In a mixing bowl, dissolve the yeast in warm water. Add buttermilk and butter, stirring until butter begins to melt. Add the whole wheat flour, brown sugar, wheat germ, salt and 4 cups all-purpose flour. Beat until smooth. Stir in enough remaining all-purpose flour to form a soft dough. Turn onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 6-8 minutes. Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease top. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 hour. Punch dough down. Turn onto a lightly floured surface; divide into four pieces. Shape into loaves. Place in four greased 8-in. x 4-in. x 2-in. loaf pans or on greased baking sheets. Cover and let rise until doubled, about 45 minutes. Bake at 375 degrees F for 30-40 minutes or until golden brown. Remove from pans to wire racks to cool."], "Image": "http://images.media-allrecipes.com/userphotos/250x250/46294.jpg", "Recipe": "Tasty Whole Wheat Bread", "Ingredients": ["2 (.25 ounce) packages active dry yeast", "1/2 cup warm water (110 degrees F to 115 degrees F)", "1 quart warm buttermilk* (110 to 115 degrees F)", "1/2 cup butter or margarine, softened", "2 1/2 cups whole wheat flour", "1/2 cup packed brown sugar", "1/3 cup toasted wheat germ", "2 1/2 teaspoons salt", "8 cups all-purpose flour"]}
