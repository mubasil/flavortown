{"Directions": ["In a large mixing bowl, combine 3/4 cup all-purpose flour, whole wheat flour, walnuts, brown sugar, yeast and salt.  In a saucepan, heat water, yogurt and margarine to 120 degrees F-130 degrees F; stir into flour mixture.  Add enough of the remaining all-purpose to form a soft dough.  Turn onto a floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic, about 6-8 minutes.  Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 hour.  Punch dough down.  Turn onto a lightly floured surface; divide into thirds.  Shape each portion into a 15-in. rope.  Place the ropes on a greased baking sheet and braid; pinch ends to seal and tuck under.  Cover and let rise until doubled, about 30 minutes.  Bake at 375 degrees F for 23-28 minutes or until golden brown.  Remove from pan to cool on a wire rack."], "Image": "http://images.media-allrecipes.com/userphotos/250x250/986686.jpg", "Recipe": "Walnut Wheat Bread", "Ingredients": ["1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour", "1 1/2 cups whole wheat flour", "3/4 cup chopped walnuts", "2 tablespoons brown sugar", "1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast", "1 teaspoon salt", "3/4 cup water", "1/3 cup reduced-fat plain yogurt", "2 tablespoons margarine"]}
