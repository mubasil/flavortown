{"Directions": ["Remove top and seeds from green pepper; cut in half lengthwise. In a large saucepan, cook the pepper halves in boiling water for 5 minutes or until crisp-tender; set aside. In a large bowl, beat eggs. Add the next seven ingredients. Crumble beef over mixture and mix well. Stuff pepper halves with some of the meat mixture. Pat half of the remaining meat mixture into an ungreased 9-in. x 5-in. x 3-in. loaf pan. Arrange pepper halves, stuffed side down, over meat mixture. Cover with remaining meat mixture. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F for 1 hour. Cover and bake 15-20 minutes longer or until meat is no longer pink and a meat thermometer reads 160 degrees F; drain. Let stand 10 minutes before slicing."], "Image": "http://images.media-allrecipes.com/global/recipes/nophoto/nopicture-910x511.png", "Recipe": "Stuffed Pepper Loaf", "Ingredients": ["1 small green bell pepper", "2 eggs", "1/2 cup milk", "1/2 cup shredded sharp Cheddar cheese", "1/4 cup ketchup", "2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce", "1/2 cup dry bread crumbs", "1 teaspoon salt", "1/4 teaspoon pepper", "2 pounds lean ground beef"]}
