{"Directions": ["In a blender or food processor, combine the walnuts, raisins and sugar; cover and process until ground. Stir in butter; set aside. Core apples and remove enough pulp to leave a 1-in. shell. Fill each apple with about 1/4 cup nut mixture. Place in a greased shallow 3-qt. baking dish. Pour water around apples. Bake, uncovered, at 375 degrees F for 50-60 minutes or until tender. Meanwhile, for custard sauce, combine the sugar, flour and salt in a saucepan. Gradually stir in milk and cream until smooth. Bring to a boil over medium heat; cook and stir for 2 minutes or until thickened. Remove from the heat. Stir a small amount of hot milk mixture into egg yolks; return all to the pan, stirring constantly. Bring to a gentle boil; cook and stir for 2 minutes. Remove from the heat; stir in vanilla. Cool. Serve over warm apples. Refrigerate any leftovers."], "Image": "http://images.media-allrecipes.com/userphotos/250x250/979355.jpg", "Recipe": "Stuffed Apples with Custard Sauce", "Ingredients": ["1 cup chopped walnuts", "1 cup raisins", "1/2 cup sugar", "1/4 cup butter or margarine, melted", "8 medium unpeeled tart apples", "1/2 cup water", "CUSTARD SAUCE:", "1/2 cup sugar", "1 tablespoon all-purpose flour", "1/8 teaspoon salt", "1 cup milk", "1 cup whipping cream", "4 egg yolks, lightly beaten", "1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract"]}
