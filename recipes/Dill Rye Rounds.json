{"Directions": ["In a mixing bowl, combine 2 cups all-purpose flour, rye flour, milk powder, yeast, sugar, salt and seasonings. In a saucepan, heat water and shortening to 120 degrees F-130 degrees F. Add to dry ingredients; beat until smooth. Stir in enough remaining all-purpose flour to form a soft dough. Turn onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 6-8 minutes. Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease top. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 45 minutes. Punch dough down. Turn onto a lightly floured surface; divide in half. Shape into two balls. Place on two greased baking sheets. Cover and let rest in a warm place until doubled, about 35 minutes. With a sharp knife, make several shallow slashes across the top of each loaf. Bake at 375 degrees F for 30-35 minutes or until golden brown. Remove from pans to wire racks to cool."], "Image": "http://images.media-allrecipes.com/userphotos/560x315/291568.jpg", "Recipe": "Dill Rye Rounds", "Ingredients": ["3 1/2 cups all-purpose flour", "1 1/2 cups rye flour", "1/2 cup instant nonfat dry milk powder", "2 (.25 ounce) packages active dry yeast", "2 teaspoons sugar", "1 teaspoon salt", "1 teaspoon caraway seeds", "1 teaspoon dill seed", "1 teaspoon dill weed", "1 3/4 cups water", "2 teaspoons shortening"]}
