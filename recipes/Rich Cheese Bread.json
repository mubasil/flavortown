{"Directions": ["In a saucepan, bring water, cornmeal and salt to a boil. Cook and stir until thickened. Remove from the heat. Add molasses and butter; cool to 120 degrees F-130 degrees F. In a mixing bowl, combine 2 cups bread flour and yeast. Add cornmeal mixture; beat until smooth. Stir in enough remaining bread flour to form a soft dough. Turn onto a surface dusted with all-purpose flour; knead until smooth and elastic, about 6-8 minutes. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 hour. Punch dough down. Turn onto a lightly floured surface; divide in half. Work half of the cheese cubes into each portion of dough. Shape into round loaves. Place in two greased 8-in. or 9-in. round baking pans. Sprinkle with additional cornmeal. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 hour. Bake at 350 degrees F for 45-50 minutes or until golden brown. Remove from pan to wire racks to cool. Store in the refrigerator."], "Image": "http://images.media-allrecipes.com/userphotos/250x250/658771.jpg", "Recipe": "Rich Cheese Bread", "Ingredients": ["2 cups water", "1/2 cup cornmeal", "1/2 teaspoon salt", "1/2 cup molasses", "2 tablespoons butter or margarine, softened", "5 cups bread flour", "1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast", "all-purpose flour", "8 ounces process American cheese, cubed", "additional cornmeal"]}
