{"Directions": ["In a mixing bowl, combine 1-1/2 cups flour, 1 cup potato flakes, sugar, yeast and salt. In a saucepan, heat the milk, butter and onions to 120 degrees F-130 degrees F. Add to dry ingredients; beat until moistened. Add eggs; beat on medium speed for 3 minutes. Stir in enough remaining flour to form a soft dough. Turn onto a surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 8-10 minutes. Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease top. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 45 minutes. Punch dough down. Cover and let rest for 15 minutes. Turn onto a floured surface; divide into 24 pieces. Shape each into a ball. Dip each ball into remaining potato flakes. Place in a greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking pan. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 30 minutes. Bake at 375 degrees F for 25-35 minutes or until golden brown. Remove from pan to a wire rack to cool."], "Image": "http://images.media-allrecipes.com/userphotos/250x250/810486.jpg", "Recipe": "Green Onion Potato Rolls", "Ingredients": ["4 1/2 cups bread flour", "1 1/4 cups instant mashed potato flakes, divided", "3 tablespoons sugar", "2 (.25 ounce) packages active dry yeast", "2 teaspoons salt", "2 cups milk", "1/2 cup butter or margarine", "4 green onions, sliced", "2 eggs", "all-purpose flour"]}
