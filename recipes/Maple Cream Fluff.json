{"Directions": ["In a large saucepan, soften gelatin in cold water; let stand for 1 minute. Cook and stir over low heat (do not boil) until gelatin is dissolved, about 4 minutes. Remove from the heat; slowly stir in syrup. Set pan in ice water; whisk in milk. Continue whisking until mixture has thickened, about 10 minutes; remove pan from ice bath and set aside. In a mixing bowl, beat cream until stiff peaks form. Fold in 3/4 cup pecans and the maple mixture. Sprinkle 1 cup wafer crumbs into a 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. dish; top with maple mixture. Sprinkle with remaining pecans and wafer crumbs. Cover and chill for at least 6 hours or overnight. Refrigerate any leftovers."], "Image": "http://images.media-allrecipes.com/global/recipes/nophoto/nopicture-910x511.png", "Recipe": "Maple Cream Fluff", "Ingredients": ["2 envelopes unflavored gelatin", "1/2 cup cold water", "1 cup maple syrup", "2 cups milk", "1 cup whipping cream", "1 cup chopped pecans, toasted, divided", "2 cups vanilla wafer crumbs"]}
