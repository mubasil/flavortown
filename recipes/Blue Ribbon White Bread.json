{"Directions": ["In a mixing bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water. Add the milk powder, shortening, sugar, salt, ginger and 3-1/2 cups flour. Beat until smooth. Stir in enough remaining flour to form a soft dough. Turn onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 6-8 minutes. Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease top. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 hour. Punch dough down. Turn onto a lightly floured surface; divide in half. Shape into loaves. Place in two greased 8-in. x 4-in. x 2-in. loaf pans. Cover and let rise until doubled, about 45 minutes. Bake at 350 degrees F for 40-45 minutes or until golden brown. Remove from pans to wire racks to cool."], "Image": "http://images.media-allrecipes.com/userphotos/250x250/773680.jpg", "Recipe": "Blue Ribbon White Bread", "Ingredients": ["1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast", "2 1/2 cups warm water (110 degrees to 115 degrees)", "1 cup instant nonfat dry milk powder", "3 tablespoons shortening", "2 tablespoons sugar", "2 teaspoons salt", "1/4 teaspoon ground ginger", "6 cups all-purpose flour"]}
