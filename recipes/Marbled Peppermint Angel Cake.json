{"Directions": ["In a mixing bowl, beat egg whites, cream of tartar, extracts and salt on high speed. Gradually add 3/4 cup of sugar, beating until stiff peaks form and sugar is dissolved. Combine flour and remaining sugar; gradually fold into the batter, 1/4 cup at a time. Divide batter in half; tint half with red food coloring. Alternately spoon plain and pink batters into an ungreased 10-in. tube pan. Cut through the batter with a knife to remove air pockets. Bake at 350 degrees F for 30-40 minutes or until cake springs back when lightly touched. Immediately invert pan; cool completely. Run a knife around sides of cake and remove from the pan. For glaze, combine confectioners' sugar, milk, extract and food coloring if desired. Drizzle over cake. Sprinkle with crushed candies."], "Image": "http://images.media-allrecipes.com/global/recipes/nophoto/nopicture-910x511.png", "Recipe": "Marbled Peppermint Angel Cake", "Ingredients": ["1 1/2 cups egg whites", "1 1/2 teaspoons cream of tartar", "1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract", "1 teaspoon peppermint extract", "1/4 teaspoon salt", "1 1/2 cups sugar, divided", "3/4 cup all-purpose flour", "6 drops red food coloring", "GLAZE:", "2 cups confectioners' sugar", "1/4 cup milk", "1/4 teaspoon peppermint extract", "6 drops red food coloring", "1/4 cup crushed peppermint candies"]}
