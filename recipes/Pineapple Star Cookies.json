{"Directions": ["In a mixing bowl, cream the butter and cream cheese. Add flour and mix well. Cover and refrigerate for 2 hours or until easy to handle. Meanwhile, in a saucepan, combine sugar rand flour; add pineapple. Cook over low heat until mixture is thickened, stirring frequently. Cover and refrigerate. Divide dough in half. On a lightly floured surface, roll out each portion to 1/8-in. thickness. Cut into 3-in. squares. Place 1 in. apart on ungreased baking sheets. To form star, make a 1-1/4-in. cut from each corner toward center (do not cut through center). Place 1/4 teaspoon of pineapple filling in the center of each. Fold every other point toward the center, overlapping pieces; press lightly to seal. Bake at 375 degrees F for 8-10 minutes or until set. Remove to wire racks to cool. For frosting, combine the confectioners' sugar, butter, milk and vanilla until smooth. Drizzle over cookies; sprinkle with walnuts."], "Image": "http://images.media-allrecipes.com/userphotos/250x250/992745.jpg", "Recipe": "Pineapple Star Cookies", "Ingredients": ["1 cup butter (no substitutes), softened", "1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened", "2 cups all-purpose flour", "FILLING:", "3/4 cup sugar", "4 1/2 teaspoons all-purpose flour", "1 (8 ounce) can crushed pineapple, drained", "FROSTING:", "1 cup confectioners' sugar", "2 tablespoons butter (no substitutes), melted", "2 tablespoons milk", "1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract", "1/2 cup chopped walnuts"]}
