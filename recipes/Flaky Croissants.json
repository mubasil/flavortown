{"Directions": ["In a mixing bowl, combine 1 cup flour, sugar, yeast and salt. Add warm water and shortening. Beat on medium speed for 2 minutes. Add 1/2 cup flour; beat 2 minutes longer. Stir in enough remaining flour to form a soft dough. Turn onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 6-8 minutes. Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease top. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 45 minutes. Punch dough down. Cover and refrigerate for 2 hours. Turn dough onto a floured surface; roll into a 15-in. x 10-in rectangle. In a small mixing bowl, beat cold butter until softened but still cold. Spread dough with a fourth of the butter. Fold dough into thirds, starting with a short side. Turn dough a quarter turn. Repeat rolling, buttering and folding three times. Wrap in plastic wrap. Refrigerate overnight. On a floured surface, roll dough into a 14-in. square. With a sharp knife, cut into quarters. Cut each quarter diagonally in half, forming two triangles. Roll up triangles from the wide end; place with pointed end down 2 in. apart on a greased baking sheet. Curve ends to form a crescent shape. Cover and refrigerate for 20 minutes. Brush with egg. Bake at 425 degrees F for 13-18 minutes or until golden brown. Remove from pan to a wire rack to cool."], "Image": "http://images.media-allrecipes.com/userphotos/250x250/592919.jpg", "Recipe": "Flaky Croissants", "Ingredients": ["2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour", "1 tablespoon sugar", "1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast", "3/4 teaspoon salt", "1 cup warm water (120 to 130 degrees F)", "1 tablespoon shortening", "1 cup cold butter (no substitutes), cubed", "1 egg, beaten"]}
