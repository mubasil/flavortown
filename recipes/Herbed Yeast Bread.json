{"Directions": ["In a mixing bowl, dissolve yeast in 1 cup water. Add butter, eggs, sugar, milk powder, salt and remaining water; mix well. Beat in 8 cups flour until smooth. Stir in enough remaining flour to form a soft dough. Turn onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 6-8 minutes. Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease top. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 hour. Punch dough down. Roll to 1/2-in. thickness; cut with a 2-1/2-in. biscuit cutter. Combine herb butter ingredients; brush over circles. Fold in half with buttered sides out. Place circles with folded edge down in five greased 8-cup fluted tube pans or 8-in. x 4-in. x 2-in. loaf pans. Bake at 350 degrees F for 20-25 minutes or until golden brown."], "Image": "http://images.media-allrecipes.com/userphotos/250x250/815493.jpg", "Recipe": "Herbed Yeast Bread", "Ingredients": ["2 tablespoons active dry yeast", "3 cups warm water (110 degrees to 115 degrees), divided", "1/4 cup butter or margarine, softened", "4 eggs, beaten", "1 cup sugar", "2/3 cup instant nonfat dry milk powder", "2 teaspoons salt", "11 cups all-purpose flour", "HERB BUTTER:", "1/4 cup butter or margarine, melted", "2 teaspoons garlic salt", "2 teaspoons dried parsley flakes", "1 teaspoon dill weed", "1/4 teaspoon dried oregano"]}
