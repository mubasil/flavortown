{"Directions": ["In a mixing bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water. Add the milk, shortening, sugar, eggs, salt, cornmeal and 4 cups flour. Beat until smooth. Stir in enough remaining flour to form a soft dough. Turn onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 6-8 minutes. Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease top. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 hour. Punch dough down. Turn onto a lightly floured surface; divide into size pieces. Shape each into  6-in. oval loaf. Grease two baking sheets; sprinkle with cornmeal. Place three loaves 3 in. apart on each prepared pan. Cover and let rise until doubled, about 30 minutes. With a sharp knife, make three shallow diagonal slashes across the top of each loaf. Bake at 400 degrees F for 15-20 minutes or until golden brown. Remove from pans to wire racks to cool."], "Image": "http://images.media-allrecipes.com/userphotos/250x250/715202.jpg", "Recipe": "Cornmeal Mini Loaves", "Ingredients": ["2 (.25 ounce) packages active dry yeast", "1 cup warm water (110 degrees to 115 degrees)", "1 cup warm milk (110 to 115 degrees F)", "1/2 cup shortening", "1/2 cup sugar", "2 eggs", "2 teaspoons salt", "1 cup cornmeal", "6 cups all-purpose flour", "additional cornmeal"]}
