{"Directions": ["Set aside 2 tablespoons evaporated milk for frosting. In a saucepan, combine pudding mix and remaining evaporated milk until smooth. Bring to a boil over medium heat, stirring constantly. Remove from the heat; stir in butter until melted. Let stand until mixture cools to 110 degrees F-115 degrees F. Meanwhile, in a mixing bowl, dissolve yeast in water. Beat in eggs, salt, 2 cups flour and pudding mixture until smooth. Stir in enough remaining flour to form a soft dough. Turn onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 6-8 minutes. Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease top. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 hour. Punch dough down and divide into thirds. Roll each portion into a 15-in. circle. Combine filling ingredients; spread 1/2 cupful over each circle. Cut each into 12 wedges; roll each into a crescent shape, starting with the wide end. Place point side down on greased baking sheets. Cover and let rise until doubled, about 45 minutes. Bake at 375 degrees F for 12-15 minutes or until golden brown. Cool on wire racks. For frosting, combine brown sugar, butter and reserved evaporated milk in a saucepan. Cook and stir over low heat until smooth. Remove from the heat; stir in confectioners' sugar until smooth. Add water if needed to achieve desired consistency.
