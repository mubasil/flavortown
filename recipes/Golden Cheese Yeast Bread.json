{"Directions": ["In a large mixing bowl, combine 3 cups flour, cheese, sugar, yeast and salt. Add milk and egg; beat on low speed until smooth. Stir in enough remaining flour to form a soft dough. Turn onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 6-8 minutes. Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease top. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 hour. Punch dough down. Divide in half and shape into two loaves. Place in two greased 9-in. x 5-in. x 3-in. loaf pans. Cover and let rise until doubled, about 45 minutes. Bake at 375 degrees F for 25-30 minutes or until golden brown. Remove from pans to cool on wire racks."], "Image": "http://images.media-allrecipes.com/userphotos/250x250/454306.jpg", "Recipe": "Golden Cheese Yeast Bread", "Ingredients": ["6 cups all-purpose flour", "2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese", "3 tablespoons sugar", "2 (.25 ounce) packages active dry yeast", "2 teaspoons salt", "2 cups warm milk", "1 egg"]}
