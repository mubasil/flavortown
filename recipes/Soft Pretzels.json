{"Directions": ["In a mixing bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water. Add the sugar, butter, salt, egg and 2 cups flour. Beat until smooth. Stir in enough remaining flour to form a stiff dough. Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease top. Cover and refrigerate for 2-24 hours. Punch dough down. Turn onto a lightly floured surface; divide in half. Cut each into 16 pieces. Roll each piece into a 20-in. rope. Shape into a pretzel. Place on greased baking sheets. Beat egg yolk and cold water; brush over pretzels. Sprinkle with coarse salt. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 25 minutes. Bake at 400 degrees F for 15-20 minutes or until golden brown. Remove from pans to wire racks to cool."], "Image": "http://images.media-allrecipes.com/userphotos/250x250/992996.jpg", "Recipe": "Soft Pretzels", "Ingredients": ["2 (.25 ounce) packages active dry yeast", "2 cups warm water (110 degrees to 115 degrees)", "1/2 cup sugar", "1/4 cup butter or margarine, softened", "2 teaspoons salt", "1 egg", "6 1/2 cups all-purpose flour", "1 egg yolk", "2 tablespoons cold water", "coarse salt"]}
