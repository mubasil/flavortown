{"Directions": ["Set aside five cherries for garnish. Chop remaining cherries; place in a mixing bowl. Add cream cheese, sugar, almond extract and pecans; beat until blended. Roll crescent roll dough. Place dough together, forming one large rectangle; seal seams and perforations. Fold dough in half lengthwise; roll into an 18-in. x 12-in. rectangle. Spread filling to within 1 in. of edges. Roll up tightly, jelly-roll style, starting with a long side; pinch seam to seal. Place seam side down on a greased baking sheet; pinch ends together to form a ring. With a scissors, cut from outside edge two-thirds of the way toward center of the ring at 1-in. intervals. Separate strips slightly; twist to allow filling to show, slightly overlapping previous piece. Bake at 375 degrees F for 20-30 minutes or until golden brown. Cover loosely with foil if the top browns to quickly. Using two large spatulas, carefully remove to a wire rack. For glaze, combine confectioners' sugar, milk and almond extract.  Drizzle over warm ring. Garnish with pecans and reserved cherries."], "Image": "http://images.media-allrecipes.com/userphotos/250x250/977245.jpg", "Recipe": "Very Cherry  Crescent Ring", "Ingredients": ["1 (10 ounce) jar maraschino cherries, drained", "1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened", "1/2 cup sugar", "1/2 teaspoon almond extract", "3/4 cup chopped pecans", "2 (8 ounce) cans refrigerated crescent rolls", "GLAZE:", "1 cup confectioners' sugar", "4 teaspoons milk", "1/4 teaspoon almond extract", "10 pecan halves"]}
