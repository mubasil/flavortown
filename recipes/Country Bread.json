{"Directions": ["In a mixing bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water. Add the milk, butter, sugar, salt, ginger, 2 eggs and 3 cups flour. Beat until smooth. Stir in enough remaining flour to form a soft dough. Turn onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 6-8 minutes. Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease top. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 hour. Punch dough down. Turn onto a lightly floured surface; divide into six pieces. Shape each into a 12-in. rope. Braid three ropes; pinch ends to seal and tuck under. Repeat with remaining dough. Place in two greased 8-in. x 4-in. x 2-in. loaf pans. Cover and let rise until doubled, about 30 minutes. Beat remaining egg; brush over dough. Sprinkle with sesame seeds. Bake at 350 degrees F for 35-40 minutes or until golden brown. Remove from pans to wire racks to cool."], "Image": "http://images.media-allrecipes.com/userphotos/560x315/1068054.jpg", "Recipe": "Country Bread", "Ingredients": ["2 (.25 ounce) packages active dry yeast", "1/2 cup warm water (110 degrees F to 115 degrees F)", "1 cup warm milk (110 to 115 degrees F)", "1/4 cup butter or margarine, softened", "1/4 cup sugar", "1 teaspoon salt", "1/4 teaspoon ground ginger", "3 eggs", "5 cups all-purpose flour", "2 tablespoons sesame seeds"]}
