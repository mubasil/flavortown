{"Directions": ["Scrub and pierce potatoes. Bake at 375 degrees F for 1 hour or until tender. When cool enough to handle, cut potatoes in half lengthwise. Carefully scoop out pulp, leaving a thin shell (refrigerate pulp for another use). Brush inside and outside of potato shells with butter. Place cut side up on an ungreased baking sheet. Bake, uncovered, at 375 degrees F for 20 minutes. Meanwhile, in a skillet, cook beef over medium heat until no longer pink; drain. Add tomatoes and taco seasoning. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat; simmer, uncovered, for 20 minutes. Spoon into potato shells; sprinkle with cheese. Bake, uncovered, 5-10 minutes longer or until cheese is melted. Top with sour cream and onions."], "Image": "http://images.media-allrecipes.com/userphotos/250x250/989694.jpg", "Recipe": "Taco Potato Shells", "Ingredients": ["3 large baking potatoes", "1 tablespoon butter or margarine, melted", "1 pound ground beef", "1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes, undrained", "1 (1.25 ounce) package taco seasoning", "1/2 cup shredded Cheddar cheese", "1/3 cup sour cream", "2 green onions, sliced"]}
