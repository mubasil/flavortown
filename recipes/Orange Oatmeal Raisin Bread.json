{"Directions": ["Place oats and raisins in a bowl. Heat 2 cups water to 120 degrees F-130 degrees F; pour over oats and raisins. Cool to 110 degrees F-115 degrees F, about 10 minutes. Place yeast in a small bowl. Heat remaining water to 110 degrees F-115 degrees F; pour over yeast to dissolve. Add to oat mixture. Add the orange juice, molasses, oil, salt and 3 cups flour; beat until smooth. Stir into enough remaining flour to form a soft dough. Turn onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 6-8 minutes. Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease top. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1-1/2 hours. Punch dough down. Turn onto a lightly floured surface; divide into thirds. Shape each into a round or oval loaf. Place on greased baking sheets. Cover and let rise until doubled, about 45 minutes. With a sharp knife, make three to five shallow slashes across the top of each loaf. Beat egg and milk; lightly brush over loaves. Bake at 350 degrees F for 35-40 minutes or until golden brown. Remove from pans to wire racks to cool."], "Image": "http://images.media-allrecipes.com/userphotos/250x250/302474.jpg", "Recipe": "Orange Oatmeal Raisin Bread", "Ingredients": ["2 cups quick-cooking oats", "1/2 cup raisins", "2 1/2 cups water, divided", "1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast", "1/2 cup orange juice", "1/2 cup molasses", "1/3 cup vegetable oil", "1 tablespoon salt", "6 cups all-purpose flour", "1 egg", "1 tablespoon milk"]}
