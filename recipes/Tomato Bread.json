{"Directions": ["In a mixing bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water. Add the tomato juice, ketchup, Parmesan cheese, sugar, butter, salt, basil, oregano and 3 cups flour. Beat until smooth. Stir in enough remaining flour to form a soft dough. Turn onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 6-8 minutes. Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease top. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1-1/4 hours. Punch dough down. Divide in half. Cover and let rest for 10 minutes. Shape into loaves. Place in two greased 9-in. x 5-in. x 3-in. loaf pans. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 hour. Bake at 375 degrees F for 25-30 minutes or until golden brown. Remove from pans to wire racks to cool."], "Image": "http://images.media-allrecipes.com/userphotos/250x250/300729.jpg", "Recipe": "Tomato Bread", "Ingredients": ["1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast", "1/4 cup warm water (105 degrees to 115 degrees)", "2 cups warm tomato juice (110 to 115 degrees F)", "1/4 cup ketchup", "1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese", "3 tablespoons sugar", "2 tablespoons butter or margarine, melted", "1 teaspoon salt", "1/2 teaspoon dried basil", "1/2 teaspoon dried oregano", "6 3/4 cups all-purpose flour"]}
