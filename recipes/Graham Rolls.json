{"Directions": ["In a mixing bowl, combine the shortening, sugar and salt. Stir in boiling water. Cool to 110 degrees F-115 degrees F. Dissolve yeast in warm water. Add yeast mixture, egg, 1 cup cracker crumbs and whole wheat flour to shortening mixture; mix well. Stir in enough all-purpose flour to form a soft dough. Turn onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 6-8 minutes. Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease top. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 hour. Punch dough down. Turn onto a lightly floured surface; divide into 48 pieces. Shape each into a ball. Dip into melted butter, then roll in remaining cracker crumbs. Place in greased muffin cups. Cover and let rise until doubled, about 30 minutes. Bake at 350 degrees F for 18-20 minutes or until golden brown. Remove from pans to wire racks to cool."], "Image": "http://images.media-allrecipes.com/global/recipes/nophoto/nopicture-910x511.png", "Recipe": "Graham Rolls", "Ingredients": ["1/2 cup shortening", "1/2 cup sugar", "1 tablespoon salt", "1 cup boiling water", "2 (.25 ounce) packages active dry yeast", "1 cup warm water (110 degrees to 115 degrees)", "1 egg", "3 cups graham cracker crumbs, divided", "2 cups whole wheat flour", "3 cups all-purpose flour", "1/3 cup butter or margarine, melted"]}
