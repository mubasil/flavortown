{"Directions": ["In a mixing bowl, beat egg whites and vinegar on medium speed until foamy. Combine sugar and cinnamon; gradually beat into egg whites, 1 tablespoon at a time, on high until stiff peaks form. Spread into the pastry shell. Bake at 325 degrees F for 20-25 minutes or until meringue is lightly browned. Cool. For filling, whisk egg yolks and water in a saucepan. Add chocolate chips; cook and stir over low heat until a thermometer reads 160 degrees F and mixture is thickened (do not boil). Cool. Spread 3 tablespoons over meringue; set remainder aside. In a mixing bowl, beat the cream, sugar and cinnamon until stiff peaks form. Spread half over the chocolate layer. Fold reserved chocolate mixture into remaining whipped cream; spread over top. Chill for 6 hours or overnight. Refrigerate any left overs."], "Image": "http://images.media-allrecipes.com/global/recipes/nophoto/nopicture-910x511.png", "Recipe": "Cinnamon Chocolate Angel Pie", "Ingredients": ["2 egg whites", "1/2 teaspoon white vinegar", "1/2 cup sugar", "1/8 teaspoon ground cinnamon", "1 (9 inch) pastry shell, baked", "Filling:", "2 egg yolks", "1/4 cup water", "1 cup semisweet chocolate chips", "1 cup whipping cream", "1/4 cup sugar", "1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon"]}
