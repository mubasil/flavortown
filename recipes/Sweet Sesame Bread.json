{"Directions": ["In a mixing bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water. Add the butter, sugar, milk powder, salt, aniseed, eggs and 2 cups flour. Beat on low speed for 3 minutes. Stir in enough remaining flour to form a soft dough. Turn onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 6-8 minutes. Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease top. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 hour. Punch dough down. Turn onto a lightly floured surface; divide into thirds. Shape each into a 15-in. rope. Place ropes on a greased baking sheet; braid. Pinch ends to seal and tick under. Cover and let rise until doubled, about 45 minutes. Beat egg and milk; brush over braid. Sprinkle with sesame seeds, almonds and sugar. Bake at 350 degrees F for 25-30 minutes or until golden brown. Remove from pan to a wire rack to cool. Serve warm or at room temperature."], "Image": "http://images.media-allrecipes.com/global/recipes/nophoto/nopicture-910x511.png", "Recipe": "Sweet Sesame Bread", "Ingredients": ["1 tablespoon active dry yeast", "1/2 cup warm water (110 degrees F to 115 degrees F)", "1/4 cup butter or margarine, softened", "1/4 cup sugar", "3 tablespoons instant nonfat dry milk powder", "1/2 teaspoon salt", "1/2 teaspoon crushed anise seeds", "2 eggs", "2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour", "TOPPING:", "1 egg", "1 tablespoon milk", "2 tablespoons sesame seeds", "2 tablespoons chopped almonds", "2 tablespoons sugar"]}
