{"Directions": ["In a mixing bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water. Add the milk, sugar, shortening, salt, eggs and 3-1/2 cups flour; beat until smooth. Stir in enough remaining flour to form a soft dough. Turn onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 6-8 minutes. Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease top. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 45 minutes. Punch dough down. Turn onto a lightly floured surface; divide in half. Roll each into a 14-in. x 9-in rectangle. Spread 1/3 cup peanut butter to within 1/2 in. of edges. Roll up, jelly-roll style, starting with a long side; pinch seam to seal. Cut each into 12 slices. Place, cut side down, in two greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking pans. Cover and let rise until doubled, about 1 hour. Bake at 375 degrees F for 20-25 minutes or until lightly brown.
