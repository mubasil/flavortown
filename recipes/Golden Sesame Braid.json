{"Directions": ["In a mixing bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water. Add the milk, shortening, sugar, salt, 3 eggs and 4 cups flour. Beat until smooth. Stir in enough remaining flour to form a soft dough. Turn onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 6-8 minutes. Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease top. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 hour. Punch dough down. Turn onto a lightly floured surface; divide in half. Divide each portion into thirds. Shape each piece into a 12-in. rope. Place three ropes on a greased baking pan; braid. Pinch ends to seal and tuck under. Repeat with remaining dough. Cover and let rise until doubled, about 45 minutes. Beat remaining egg and cold water; brush over braids. Sprinkle with sesame seeds. Bake at 350 degrees F for 30-35 minutes or until golden brown. Remove from pans to wire racks to cool."], "Image": "http://images.media-allrecipes.com/userphotos/250x250/982441.jpg", "Recipe": "Golden Sesame Braid", "Ingredients": ["2 (.25 ounce) packages active dry yeast", "1/2 cup warm water (110 degrees F to 115 degrees F)", "1 1/2 cups warm milk (110 to 115 degrees F)", "1/4 cup shortening", "1/4 cup sugar", "1 tablespoon salt", "4 eggs", "7 cups all-purpose flour", "1 tablespoon cold water", "2 tablespoons sesame seeds"]}
