Wrap tightly and freeze for 20 minutes. Sprinkle 1/3 cup sugar on a lightly floured surface; roll each portion of dough into a 12-in. square. Combine almonds, cinnamon and remaining sugar; sprinkle over dough. Using a rolling pin, press nut mixture into dough. Cut into 1-in. strips; cut each strip widthwise into thirds.
