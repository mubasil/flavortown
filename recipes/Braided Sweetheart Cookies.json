{"Directions": ["In a mixing bowl, cream butter and sugar. Beat in egg and vanilla. Combine the flour, baking powder and salt; gradually add to creamed mixture. Divide dough in half; tint one portion pink, leaving the remaining portion white. Wrap each portion in plastic wrap; refrigerate for 4 hours or overnight. For each cookie, shape a 1-in. ball of each color into an 8-in. rope. Place a pink and white rope side-by-side; press together gently and twist. Place 2 in. apart on ungreased baking sheets; shape into a heart and pinch ends to seal. Bake at 350 degrees F for 8-11 minutes or until edges are lightly browned. Cool on wire racks."], "Image": "http://images.media-allrecipes.com/userphotos/250x250/981385.jpg", "Recipe": "Braided Sweetheart Cookies", "Ingredients": ["1 cup butter (no substitutes), softened", "1 1/2 cups confectioners' sugar", "1 egg", "1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract", "2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour", "1/2 teaspoon baking powder", "1/2 teaspoon salt", "6 drops red food coloring"]}
